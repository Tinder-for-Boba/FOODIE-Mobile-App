## Overview
### Description
Want a decent meal with your friends, but don't know where to meet up? Well look no further, because going on food dates has never been easier with **FOODIE**, the ultimate food dating app! Just input your taste preferences and you will be put in contact with friends who have similar tastes as well as restaurants that sell those food items!

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Food & Drink, Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app will be developed for iPhone. 
- **Story:** As a user I want to be able to find other people with similar food tastes so that I can schedule food dates and hang-outs with them at our favorite restaurants.
- **Market:** Students, couples, foodies, anyone who wants to bond with another human being over food.
- **Habit:** How often the app will be used is depending on how often users want to network with friends over food topics.
- **Scope:** First, we would start with making a meetup app for a niche audience who want to bond over food, then this idea may develop into a broader social media platform for users who would like to partake in food-related networking.
